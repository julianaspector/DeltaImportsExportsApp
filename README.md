# Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Water Imports and Exports R Shiny App Documentation

## Introduction
The Sacramento Water Allocation Model (SacWAM) is a hydrologic and system operations model developed by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) and State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board) to assess potential revisions to instream flow and other requirements in the Bay-Delta Watershed including the current Sacramento/Delta review and update of the 2006 Water Quality Control Plan for the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary (2006 Bay-Delta Plan). 
SacWAM was developed using the Water Evaluation And Planning (WEAP) software platform, and is intended to be user-friendly and usable for efficient comparison of multiple scenarios.
